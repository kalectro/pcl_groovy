INSTRUCTIONS:

This instruction assumes that you have:
0) installed Android SDK, Android NDK.
1) compiled VES (including VTK, KiwiViewer) for Android (http://vtk.org/Wiki/VES/Developers_Guide) 
2) compiled Point Cloud Library for Android in conjunction with VTK, VES, and Kiwi (http://vtk.org/Wiki/VES/Point_Cloud_Library)

To build, you will need special versions of libusb and OpenNI. To build
them, go to /3rdparty/android and run the provided scripts:

./libusb-fetch.sh
./libusb-build.sh
./openni-fetch.sh
./openni-build.sh

After that, run the following in this directory (<pcl> means the full path to the PCL sources):

export NDK_MODULE_PATH=<pcl>/3rdparty/android/ndk-modules
ndk-build


Patch VES Library, rebuild VES library:

cd PATH_TO_VES_DIR 
git apply vesKiwi.patch

Change dependencies in the next files:
build/my.sh
Replace all “/home/andrey/...” to your  own path to libraries.


Next, from this directory execute the following commands:

# configure ant:
./configure_ant.sh  
# configure cmake:
build/my.sh

# build native:
cd build
make
#build java:
ant debug

# run on a device
ant debug install
