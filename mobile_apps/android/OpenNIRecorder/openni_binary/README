IMPORTANT: This step is required to enable the OpenNI support.

run ./build_openni_script.sh 

this will create a new directory at ../../openni_drivers 

the binary will be created automatically

then run on the terminal

#adb shell
#mkdir /data/ni
#mount -o remount rw /system

Lastly, we do 

sh push_lib.sh 

to push the .so to the device. 

After that we shall run to mount the usbfs (this is required*** after every reboot).

mount -o devmode=0666 -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb
