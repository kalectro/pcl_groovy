Android Port for Pointcloud Library
-----------------------------------

WARNING: currently work in progress / experimental - nothing is guaranteed, try it at your own risk


Prerequisites
-------------

* android-cmake -> by Ethan
* boost for android -> use Ethan's patches
* eigen for android (need hack because the android compiler (arm-linux-androideabi-g++) does not pass
  the math library presence test -> no log function in math.h ??? - need to verify this or find equivalent
* flann for android -> compiles out of the box


Modifications to PCL
--------------------

* need to eliminate all VTK references from pcl_surface, pcl_io
* find a solution for endianness checks in some PCL preprocessor directives in 
  common/include/sensor_msgs/PointCloud2.h and io/include/pcl/io/ply.h
* boost for android does not have the date-time module



Roadmap
-------

* write script for creating .apk application and test it on emulator
* patch PCL code regarding the issues mentioned above
* integrate VES

* write a proper README / tutorial :-)
